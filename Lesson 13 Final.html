At this point, you should have written all of the paragraphs for a cover letter.

Once you have your cover letter written, it is VERY important to make sure that there are no mistakes!

<em>What do you think about the following sentences?</em>
<ol>
 	<li>I would make a good babysitter because I am responsible and I love children.</li>
 	<li>I pay goodattention to detials so I would be be a good secretary.</li>
</ol>
An employer who sees a lot of errors on something you send them (even just an email) will probably not expect you to be a careful or detail-oriented employee!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Steps for Editing a Cover Letter</strong></span>
<ol>
 	<li>First, you should read your cover letter over carefully and correct any errors you find.</li>
 	<li>After you have edited it, give it to at least one other person to also check for mistakes!</li>
 	<li>Finally, re-read your cover letter one more time before sending it to an employer.</li>
</ol>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What should you be looking for when you edit?</strong></span>
<ul>
 	<li>Spelling and grammar errors</li>
 	<li>Content that makes sense and sounds good when read out loud</li>
 	<li>Sentences that flow together</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Editing a Cover Letter</strong></h3>
Editing is an important skill to have! As you get better at editing, you will also become a better writer. <em>How will editing help you to get a job?</em>

On the previous page, sentences 1 and 2 proved that a poorly edited piece of writing can make an employer think that you are careless or sloppy – not traits that you want in a workplace!

In addition to fixing spelling and grammar, editing involves changing the language and structure that you use. You might:
<ul>
 	<li>Replace a boring verb with one of the exciting action words.</li>
 	<li>Make your paragraphs more concise.</li>
 	<li>Realize that you need to talk more about your own qualifications for the job.</li>
</ul>
Making these changes will improve your cover letter in ways that will make an employer notice. Remember that they might read through many cover letters for each job, and having an edited and revised letter will hopefully get you an interview!
_________________________________________________________________________________
Here are some strategies you can use to make the editing process easier!
<ol>
 	<li>Slowly read the text out loud or in your head. Anytime something sounds wrong, pause and make a correction before continuing on.</li>
 	<li>Ask a friend to<strong> read the text out loud</strong> to you, and ask them to <strong>pause</strong> so you can make a correction whenever you hear something that doesn’t sound right.</li>
 	<li>To catch spelling mistakes,<strong> read each sentence backwards</strong>! Look at the last word in the sentence, then the second-to-last word, etc. Make sure that you consider each word individually to see if it is spelled correctly.</li>
 	<li>Scan through for question words such as <strong>Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How</strong> at the beginning of sentences. Make sure that at the end of the sentence you have the correct punctuation!</li>
 	<li>If your document is on the computer, try <strong>printing it out</strong> and making your <strong>edits with a pen.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Take a break!</strong> If you have been working on your cover letter for a long time, try coming back to it later so you can read it with fresh eyes.</li>
</ol>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Proofreading Symbols and Abbreviations</span> are easy reminders of what to change in your writing. It is important to know how to write these and understand them, since this will help you to make your cover letter and other documents better!
<blockquote><strong>Proofreading Symbols and Abbreviations</strong> – Marks or letters that can be written onto a section of text to show what change should be made.
