Now that we have learned about four sections of a resume, let’s think about WHY we are writing one in the first place!<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-44180" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/PYD_resumes3-e1515773796517.png" alt="pyd_resumes3" width="100" height="98" />

Another section on your resume is very similar to the work experience section: <strong>Volunteer Experience.</strong>

As a reminder, these are the sections of a resume:
<ol>
 	<li>Heading (personal information)</li>
 	<li>Objective Statement</li>
 	<li>Education</li>
 	<li>Work Experience</li>
 	<li><strong>Volunteer Experience</strong></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #808080;">Skills</span></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #808080;">Optional Sections</span></li>
</ol>
Many people writing a resume for the first time may have not had work experience before, but <em><span style="color: #ff0000;">volunteer experience</span> can be just as impressive to a potential employer!</em>
<blockquote><strong>Volunteer Experience</strong> – This section on a resume lists your most relevant volunteer experience as well as the skills and responsibilities you had in those positions.</blockquote>
What types of volunteer experience are good to include on a resume? Read the two following sentences and think about which one is more appropriate.
<ol>
 	<li>I would make a good salesperson because I once volunteered for an hour cleaning up trash in a park.</li>
 	<li>I would make a good salesperson because I spent two years volunteering in the concession stand of my high school, and this taught me how to have good customer service and deal with unhappy customers.</li>
</ol>
On your resume, the different volunteer experiences you include should be <strong>relevant</strong>. Relevant volunteer experience is considered to be:
<ul>
 	<li>Is long term (so more than just one time!)</li>
 	<li>Teaches you<em> transferable skills</em>.</li>
</ul>
Volunteer experience is an optional section for a resume. There are two reasons you would include a volunteer experience section:
<ul>
 	<li>You have <strong>relevant</strong> volunteer experience that will help you in your next job.</li>
 	<li>You want to show your commitment to service and diverse experiences.</li>
</ul>
_________________________________________________________________________________
There are <strong>two types</strong> of volunteer sections on a resume.

The FIRST we will call the <strong>“Expanded List”</strong> type. This is written exactly like a work experience section! Make sure it includes these components:
<ol>
 	<li>Name of the organization you volunteered for</li>
 	<li>Dates you worked as a volunteer (month and year)</li>
 	<li>City and state</li>
 	<li>Duties or responsibilities you had</li>
</ol>
Here is an example of an <strong>Expanded List</strong> format:

<img class="size-medium wp-image-44197 aligncenter" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/PYD_resumes3.1-1000x618.png" alt="pyd_resumes3-1" width="1000" height="618" />

Another type of volunteer position we will call the <strong>“Short List”</strong>.

Employers will still be impressed by employees who can give back and help others, so still include this information! If you do not have room on your resume or significant volunteer experience, your section might look like this:<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-44198" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/PYD_resumes3.2.png" alt="pyd_resumes3-2" width="764" height="401" />

Should you include Volunteer Experience on a resume? If so, what type of list should it be? If you aren’t sure, follow this flow chart for an easy guide!

&nbsp;
_________________________________________________________________________________
Now we will be looking at how to write your skills section within your resume. This section will follow your volunteer experience section, which we just learned how to write! Here is the current order for your resume sections:

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-44209" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/PYD_resumes3.5-e1515781199456.png" alt="pyd_resumes3-5" width="200" height="232" />
<ol>
 	<li>Heading (personal information)</li>
 	<li>Objective Statement</li>
 	<li>Education</li>
 	<li>Work Experience</li>
 	<li>Volunteer Experience</li>
 	<li><strong>Skills</strong></li>
 	<li><span style="color: #808080;">Optional Sections</span></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<blockquote><strong>Skills</strong> – This section on a resume lists specific career-related things you are good at.</blockquote>
Skills is an optional section on your resume, but one that usually looks good to an employer and is an easy way to tell them what you can contribute to a job.
________________________________________________________________________________
There are two types of skills sets that employers are looking for: <span style="color: #ff0000;">hard</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">soft</span>.
<blockquote><strong>Hard Skills</strong> – Specific types of knowledge that allow you to complete your work-related tasks. These skills can be taught to someone and are quantifiable, or able to be measured.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Soft Skills</strong> – Skills that can be applied to a job and are usually people-related. These skills are not quantifiable (cannot be measured) and are harder to teach on the job.</blockquote>
Try to include both in your skill section!

________________________________________________________________________________Now, write your own <strong>Expanded List</strong>! Fill out the information for your previous or current volunteer experiences (in descending chronological order).

Here is the template, now fill in each blank. If you have not volunteered before, think about a volunteer position that you would like to have in the future, and write down the duties you would have!

What types of skills should go into this section? You are given a job description. Choose which skills you believe are relevant such that your employer will be happy to see them on your resume!

Let's try to brainstorm some ideas as to why having a good resume is important!
