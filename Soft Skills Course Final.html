<strong>Communication Part 1 - Listening</strong>

<strong>What is active listening?</strong>

We talked about active listening during an interview, but it also applies to the workplace (and every other part of your life)! Active listening involves several things:
<ul>
 	<li>STOP what are you doing and face the speaker.</li>
 	<li>LOOK at the person speaking to you.</li>
 	<li>SHOW physical cues that you’ve heard the speaker (nod, say “Uh huh,” etc.).</li>
 	<li>REPEAT what the speaker has said to you to demonstrate that you have understood.</li>
 	<li>DON’T fake it! If you don’t understand, ask for clarification.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

ASK YOURSELF: Do I feel comfortable asking for clarification?

<!-- Communication Part 2: Conveying Ideas Accurately-->
<em>Would you recognize a good listener if you saw one? How about a bad one? </em>

Let’s find out. Watch two role plays and, on the next page, note the good listening skills and the poor listening skills each person displays.

If your boss says….

<strong><em>“Hi, how are you doing? I was wondering how soon you would have the reports finished? If you can, before you give them to me could you change Appendix A so that it has next month’s data instead of last month’s? One other thing is I was hoping that you could take our sales data and enter it into that spreadsheet. Whenever you are finished with both of those things, you can send them to me. Thanks!”</em></strong>

Watch your instructor pretend to be an employee listening to their boss, and <strong>take notes</strong> on what their behavior is like! Which listening skills are good or bad?

<em>How do you make sure that what you are saying or writing is understood?</em>

<ul>
 	<li>Make sure you KNOW what you want to say before you say it.</li>
 	<li>Make sure that the person listening or reading understands.</li>
 	<li>Look for verbal and physical cues that they understand.</li>
 	<li>Understand TIMING. If your supervisor is very busy, he or she may not be able to pay attention to you immediately. It may be better to wait for a time when they are not as busy.</li>
</ul>
Let’s play a game about listening on the next page.
