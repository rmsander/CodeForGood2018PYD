<strong>The week of your interview:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><u>Do your research!</u> Look up information about the job you are applying to on:
<ul>
 	<li>The company website. Here you can find information on their history, mission, products, and more.</li>
 	<li>The job advertisement. Remind yourself of what exactly they are looking for! Some jobs may have a longer description online.</li>
 	<li>Use a search engine to look up other sources of information about the business.</li>
 	<li>Think about whether you would be a good fit for the job! Do the job hours work with your schedule? Do you think you have all of the necessary skills?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<u>Questions you should be able to answer:</u>

<em>What are the company’s goals?</em>

<em>How will I contribute to the company?</em>

<em>What makes me a good fit for this job?</em>

<em>What are some of the skills/experiences you have that would be good to mention in an interview?</em>

<strong>Write down notes about what you find or key points about the job, and bring them to the interview with you!</strong>
<ol start="2">
 	<li><u>Figure out where your interview will be.</u> If you have never been to the building where your interview is going to be, look it up! You don’t want to get lost, and you definitely don’t want to be late. A good idea is to do a practice run to see how long it takes.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li><u>Practice, practice, practice!</u> We will talk more about practicing for interviews in the next few lessons!</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>The day before your interview: <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-44406" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Suit-interviews-4a-e1516285065612.jpg" alt="suit-interviews-4a" width="200" height="134" /></strong>
<ol>
 	<li><u>Lay out the clothes you are planning to wear! </u></li>
</ol>
<strong>Tips for Dressing</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>What should you wear to an interview? You should wear something that looks clean, professional, and will not be distracting to the person interviewing you. This is called professional attire.</li>
 	<li>For many jobs, it would be a good idea to wear a suit to an interview (suit jacket, slacks or skirt, button-down shirt, nice shoes).</li>
</ul>
<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44410" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Business-Casual-interviews-4a-1-150x150.jpg" alt="business-casual-interviews-4a" width="150" height="150" />
<ul>
 	<li>However, if you are applying to a casual workplace, a less-formal outfit such as khaki pants and a collared shirt may be okay.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>If you aren’t sure what to wear, always pick the more formal outfit!</strong> It might impress the person interviewing you. You can also show your outfit ideas to someone you respect to get their opinion.</li>
 	<li>If you don’t have appropriate interview clothes, this is a good time to get some since you will need them for many things in the future. Or, you can borrow clothes from siblings or friends.</li>
 	<li>Depending on where you are interviewing, tattoos and piercings may not be encouraged at work. Therefore, think about removing piercings and covering tattoos if you are going to an interview. If you are offered the job, you can ask your employer about the workplace dress code.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<u>Examples of Different Workplace Types</u>

<strong>Casual Startup Business</strong>

A startup business is usually a new business that is casual and has many young employees. Often, the dress code is relaxed and informal. An example is working for a company that writes smartphone apps.

<strong>Creative Workplace</strong>

Some work environments are artistic and encourage individual expression. If you work in an art studio or a skateboard shop, they might encourage you to show off your individual style.

<strong>Business Casual Office</strong>

Many office settings will require business casual dress. This is clothing that is conservative and professional, but not as formal as requiring a suit every day. Many secretarial, engineering, or teaching positions will require business casual.

<strong>Formal Business</strong>

Formal business attire can be found in many legal and business offices. This means wearing very formal suits in conservative styles and colors.

<ol>
 	<li><u>Get everything together you will need for your interview.</u> This should include:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>A notepad for taking notes</li>
 	<li>Your research notes about the company and job</li>
 	<li>Several (at least five) copies of your resume</li>
 	<li>A list of questions you have about the job or company</li>
 	<li>A briefcase or folder for holding your papers</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li><u>Reread your resume.</u> Print out a copy for yourself, and read it so that you remember what you can talk about. Maybe even circle a few things on it that are most relevant to the job description!</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li><u>Set an alarm.</u> Do anything you need to do so that you wake up early enough, such as asking someone to call you in the morning or setting several alarms. Set the alarm extra early to be safe!</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
 	<li><u>Sleep!</u> You will be more likely to wake up on time if you go to bed early. Enough sleep will also help you to perform better in your interview!</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>The day of the interview:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><u></u> Make sure you are clean with hair and teeth brushed.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li><u>Leave early.</u> Public transportation and traffic can be unpredictable, so give yourself more than enough time! Employers are okay if you are early, but will be unimpressed if you are late.</li>
</ol>
<em>If you are more than ten minutes early, find a bench or coffee shop to wait at so that the interviewer doesn’t feel pressured<img class="size-full wp-image-44420 alignleft" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/checklist-interviews-4a.png" alt="checklist-interviews-4a" width="180" height="180" /> to start the interview early.

<strong>When You Get an Interview Offer</strong>

An employer may call or email you to offer you an interview! While this is exciting, it is also very important that you pay attention to the details of what they are telling you. One example is the <strong>location</strong> of the interview. Write down any other things you think you should find out about your interview:
<ol>
 	<li>________________________________________________________</li>
 	<li>________________________________________________________</li>
 	<li>________________________________________________________</li>
</ol>
Make sure that you WRITE DOWN this information in a calendar or in your phone so you do not forget when or where it is!

To practice, take notes on the details of your interview. Raise your hand to ask any relevant questions!

<em>“Congratulations! ABC Company would like to ask you to come in for an interview! We have scheduled it for next Thursday at 7:00. We are located on Main Street, and when you come in please ask for Ms. Lopez.”</em>
