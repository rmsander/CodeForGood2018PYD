<strong>Optional Sections of a Resume</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Heading (Personal Information)</li>
 	<li>Objective Statement</li>

There are several sections at the end of a resume that can fill up the extra space and make your resume story more complete!

The following is a list of some ideas for extra sections:

<strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-44159" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Language-icon-resumes-2d.png" alt="language-icon-resumes-2d" width="122" height="119" />Languages</strong>

If you know several languages, you might want to make this its own category instead of grouping it under “Skills.”

<em>Do you know any languages?</em>

This is a place to write down your extracurricular experiences and interests. Most employers won’t care that you like to read in your spare time. However, an activity like “Spanish Club” or “soccer team” shows that you can work in groups and have diverse interests and goals.

<em>Write down some of your strong activities here:</em>

You can choose to call this section “Awards” or “Honors.” You should include any awards from school (Perfect Attendance, Honor Roll, etc.) as well as any scholarships or <em>relevant</em> competitions you have won within the past couple of years.

<em>Write any awards you have here:</em>

Leadership is a great section for almost any job! Include any leadership positions you have held at jobs or in school (club officer, team captain) as well as any time you have been a project leader for a class.

This section of the resume could be useful for very specific types of jobs. For example, if you are working with groups of people it might be useful to be First Aid or CPR certified. Some jobs will require certifications, such as lifeguarding or babysitting.

This is a good place to list classes you’ve taken that will help you at your job! Make sure of two things:
<ul>
 	<li>You list more than one course.</li>
 	<li>They are courses that were <strong>elective </strong>classes! If you write down “English, Geometry” this tells an employer nothing since most people take these classes. Instead, try “Intro to Law” if you are looking to work in a legal setting.</li>
</ul>

We already learned about the “Skills” section of a resume, which is also an optional section to include! This could be computer skills, machine skills, artistic skills, or anything else that is relevant.

<strong>Lesson 7 – Resumes Part 4</strong>

Can you name all of the sections of a resume that we’ve talked about so far?

&nbsp;

Take a look at the resume on the next page. All of the important sections are there, but there is still some room at the bottom! Use the resume to answer these questions:

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>From her resume, what type of position is Meredith Andrews applying for?</li>
</ol>
________________________________________________________

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Based on what you already know about this type of job, what kind of qualities should she have for this position? List three or four in the spaces below.</li>
</ol>
____________________________________________________

____________________________________________________

____________________________________________________

____________________________________________________

&nbsp;

<strong>Now:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Place a check mark </strong>next to any of the qualities you wrote above that she shows experience in on her resume.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li><strong>Circle</strong> the qualities you wrote above that you think still need to be included in the resume!</li>
</ol>

To practice, look at the job ads below (the same ones we used in Lesson 6):
<table style="height: 91px;" width="1498">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="12"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Administrative assistant</strong><strong>. Highly organized, self-motivated person responsible for all personnel processing, knowledgeable in Microsoft Windows Applications and QuickBooks. Must have good people skills, be dependable and trustworthy. Please apply in person.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="12"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><strong>Camp YEP is looking for enthusiastic, dedicated trip leaders for the summer. This is a fantastic opportunity to be part of a growing adventure program and to touch the lives of campers. We currently have a need for counselors with experience in Kayaking, Canoeing, Climbing, Hiking, and Wilderness Skills. Staff members will plan, execute, and evaluate camp activities and off-camp trips.</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
For each of these job ads, think of one optional section that would be useful to have on a resume for this job. Once you decide on a category, think of three specific examples that could go in that section and be relevant for the position. For example:

<em>Camp YEP:<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-44173" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cabin-resumes-2d-1.png" alt="cabin-resumes-2d" width="293" height="236" /></em>

<em><strong>Certifications:</strong></em>
<ul>
 	<li><em>CPR </em></li>
 	<li><em>First Aid</em></li>
 	<li><em>Swimming Instructor </em></li>
</ul>
