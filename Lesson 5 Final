So far, we have learned about resume <strong>headings</strong> and <strong>objective statements</strong>. How much do you remember from last lesson?

________________________________________________________________________________

Now that you are experts on the first two parts of a resume, let’s look at the third:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Education<img class="wp-image-44147 alignright" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Graduation-Cap-Education-resumes-2b.png" alt="graduation-cap-education-resumes-2b" width="350" height="237" /></strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>
</strong></span>

1. Heading (Personal Information)

2. Objective Statement

<strong>3. Education</strong>

4. Work Experience

5. Volunteer Experience

6. Skills

7. Optional Sections

The education section of a resume tells an employer about your past experience in school. This is important because certain jobs may require a type of degree, and employers may be impressed by a candidate that is a good student.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-44123" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Education-Definition-resumes-2b-1000x233.png" alt="education-definition-resumes-2b" width="750" height="175" />

Take a look at the resume on the next page to see one example of how this looks!

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-44221" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sample-Resume-Education-resumes-2b-830x1000.png" alt="sample-resume-education-resumes-2b" width="830" height="1000" />

<strong>Note: </strong>If you have been out of school and working for a long time, it may make more sense to put the “work experience” section ahead of education.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>What information should go in an Education section?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Name of all high schools and colleges you have attended</li>
 	<li>City and state of each school</li>
 	<li>Type of degree you received (high school diploma or GED count!)</li>
 	<li>Month and year that you graduated or will graduate from each school</li>
</ul>
<em>Optional information</em>
<ul>
 	<li><em>GPA – only include your GPA if you are proud of it!</em></li>
 	<li><em>Honors – if you do not have a separate resume section for “Honors” or “Awards”, you can include <strong>academic</strong> achievements here.</em></li>
 	<li><em>Examples of this are “honor roll” or “dean’s high honors”</em></li>
</ul>

<strong><u>Work Experience</u></strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Heading (Personal Information)</li>
 	<li>Objective Statement</li>
 	<li>Education</li>
 	<li><strong>Work Experience</strong></li>
 	<li>Volunteer Experience</li>
 	<li>Skills</li>
 	<li>Optional Sections</li>
</ol>
The work experience section is the other very important part of your resume, because employers want to know what skills, experience, and knowledge you can bring to their workplace!

<img class="alignnone wp-image-44231" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Work-Experience-Definition-resumes-2b-1000x203.png" alt="work-experience-definition-resumes-2b" width="750" height="152" />

What information should you include in the work experience section?
<ul>
 	<li>Name of previous company or employer</li>
 	<li>Employer location (city and state)</li>
 	<li>Your job title</li>
 	<li>Months and years of employment</li>
 	<li>Your duties and accomplishments at that job</li>
</ul>
The words you use to describe your responsibilities are very important!

Even if you mastered a skill that you think will not help you in your next job, try to think about what transferrable skills were involved.

<u>Wording of the Job Statement</u>

When describing past jobs, be sure to focus on three things:
<ul>
 	<li>Transferrable skills you learned</li>
 	<li>Accomplishments</li>
 	<li>Results or impact of what you did</li>
</ul>
This should be done using “one-line” statements that are not complete sentences, but focus on your skills by using <strong>powerful action verbs.</strong>

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-44247" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Action-Verbs-resumes-2b-1000x475.png" alt="action-verbs-resumes-2b" width="750" height="356" />

<strong><u>DO NOT use words in your resume that you could not correctly use in a sentence</u></strong>

It does not look good to an employer if you use a word incorrectly!

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Formatting the Resume</u></strong>

The most important thing to remember is that the resume should be easy to read! What does this look like?
<ul>
 	<li>All headings, dates, and information should line up</li>
 	<li>Make headings and titles <strong>BOLD </strong>so they stand out</li>
 	<li>Keep all information concise</li>
</ul>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-44252" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Concise-Definition-resumes-2b-1000x172.png" alt="concise-definition-resumes-2b" width="750" height="129" />

For example, if you worked as a camp counselor:

<strong><u>Not concise:</u></strong> “Responsible for watching and supervising a large group of students during day-to-day activities while they attended camp, including nightly cabin checks, dinner duty, and general supervision.”

<strong><u>Concise:</u></strong> “Supervised forty campers to make sure activities were safe and organized.”

&nbsp;

When writing a resume, it is not necessary to use complete sentences!

________________________________________________________________________________
Add any other transferrable skills that you think are important! Write them here:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

________________________________________________________________________________
Brainstorm one or two transferrable skills that would go along with these everyday workplace activities:
<ol>
 	<li>Answered phones</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Cleaned the office</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
 	<li>Worked a cash register</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Filed papers</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Even though these do not seem like tasks that could help you in your job search, this is still valuable experience. You just have to describe it in the right way!

________________________________________________________________________________
Which of the following statements do you think sounds better to an employer?
<ol>
 	<li>Made Excel spreadsheets</li>
 	<li>Entered data into Excel</li>
 	<li>Organized data using Excel</li>
</ol>
<strong>Tip: </strong>To make an excellent one-line statement, be sure to include a result:

<em>Organized data using Excel to improve the efficiency of the team meetings</em>

</ul>
&nbsp;

 	<li>I used my degree in Finance to develop marketing strategies and sales programs in support of our three major product lines, which increased profitability by 30% in the first year.</li>
