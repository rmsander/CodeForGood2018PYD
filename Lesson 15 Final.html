 	<li><u>Breath counting</u> – Breathe in through your nose for 2 counts, hold the breath for 1 count, then breathe out through your mouth for 4 counts. Repeat for several minutes.</li>
 	<li><u>Belly breathing</u> – Place one hand on your stomach and one on your chest. Breathe in through your nose, feeling your stomach expand but your chest stay still. Breathe out through your mouth and repeat.</li>

<strong>Positive Thinking Techniques</strong>

Positive thinking and visualization are techniques used by professional athletes to put themselves into a winning mindset, but the same tricks will help you succeed in any part of your life!

<strong>Interview Visualization Example:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes.</li>
 	<li>Take deep, calming breaths and focus on relaxing all of your muscles.</li>
 	<li>Sit quietly for a few minutes breathing and relaxing.</li>
 	<li>Begin to think about your strongest qualities and your best accomplishments.</li>
 	<li>Make a few positive statements about these qualities, such as “I am very organized” or “I have a perfect attendance record at school.”</li>
 	<li>Picture yourself in an interview, dressed nicely, doing a great job.</li>
 	<li>Think positive thoughts such as “I will get the job.”</li>
 	<li>Open your eyes and smile.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Other Positive Thinking Tips:<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-44433" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Thumbs-Up-Interviews-4b-150x150.png" alt="thumbs-up-interviews-4b" width="150" height="150" /></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Remember, employers understand that you’re nervous! If you are worried, you can say near the beginning of your interview “I am a little bit nervous” and they will probably understand how you are feeling.</li>
 	<li>The interviewers are interested in you since they offered you an interview. Therefore, they are eager to impress you too!</li>
 	<li>Practice smiling during your answers for confidence.</li>
 	<li>While you are getting ready in the morning, play music that pumps you up and makes you happy.</li>
</ul>
