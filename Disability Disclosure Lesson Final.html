<strong>What is Disclosure?</strong>

If you have a disability, there are many questions to consider with a new job. First you should consider whether or not to disclose your disability.

What does “disclosure” mean?

Example of a Disclosure Statement:

If you choose to disclose, you also need to think about:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>How</strong> and <strong>when</strong> you will do it</li>
 	<li><strong>To whom</strong> you will disclose</li>
 	<li><strong>Whether</strong> you want to disclose your full disability or just part of it</li>
</ul>
This is an important decision, so ask the advice of a parent or trusted adult if you think you need to!

<strong>Disclosure Script Ideas</strong>

You may have to practice several times before you get it just right. Here are some suggestions:
<ul>
 	<li>Discuss your positive workplace traits first.</li>
 	<li>Identify the limitations or challenges you face at work due to your disability.</li>
 	<li>Identify which accommodations have worked for you in the past.</li>
 	<li>Consider how disclosing can help your employer and your coworkers.</li>
</ul>
Here is an example of how you can put all of these ideas together to create a script that you can practice for disclosing to an employer.

<strong><em>“Hi Mr. Brown, I was hoping I could talk to you in private for a minute? I feel that I have been a very productive employee during my time here, and I think that I am helping to make the office more organized and efficient. However, I have a disability that makes it hard for me to keep my energy up unless I eat more often. This means that I find myself tired and less productive near the end of the workday. When I was in school, my teachers let me take short breaks to eat, and this helped me keep my energy and focus up for the whole day. I was hoping that instead of taking one hour-long lunch break, I could instead take four fifteen-minute breaks throughout the day. I think that this would increase my work output, and I could help to keep the office running even near closing time! Thank you for considering this.”</em></strong>

<strong>Should You Disclose?</strong>

Think about the responsibilities of the job: <em>Do you need an accommodation in order to perform the job responsibilities?</em>

If the answer is YES, then you most likely want to disclose! You should come up with a plan for how and when to disclose, and what accommodations you will ask for.

<!-- Activity: Pros and Cons od Disclosing Your Disabiities -->
Remember that accommodations need to be specific to the challenges you face because of your disability. For example:

<strong>Disability:</strong><strong> Bad Back</strong>

<strong>Challenge</strong>: back pain from sitting in a non-supportive desk chair

<strong>How this affects job performance:</strong> pain distracts you from your work, you are less productive and more cranky at work

<strong>Requested accommodation:</strong> a new desk chair that offers lower back support

<strong>Disability:</strong><strong> Autism</strong>

<strong>Challenge:</strong> surrounding noises and movement are distracting and irritating

<strong>How this affects job performance:</strong> you cannot focus at work, you are not being productive, you are making many mistakes in your work

<strong>Requested accommodation:</strong> a desk that faces the corner of the office, wearing noise-cancelling headphones while working

When you disclose your disability to an employer, make sure to <em>suggest</em> one or more accommodations that would help you in the workplace. This takes the pressure off of your employer to find a solution!

<!-- Activity: Writign Your Own Reasonable Accomodations -->
However, not all accommodations are reasonable! Can you tell which ones are unreasonable for an employer to do?
<ol>
 	<li>You have ADHD and have struggle with staying focused for long periods of time. You request that your employer breaks down larger tasks into a series of smaller tasks.
<ul>
 	<li>Is this a reasonable accommodation?</li>
 	<li>If not, what would be a more reasonable accommodation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>You have a vision impairment that makes it difficult to look at a computer screen for long periods of time. You request that one of your coworkers does all of your typing and spreadsheet work for you while you take a nap to rest your eyes.
<ul>
 	<li>Is this a reasonable accommodation?</li>
 	<li>If not, what would be a more reasonable accommodation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>You are in a wheelchair and your cubicle space is not large enough to maneuver your chair into. You request that your employer moves the company to a new site with enough space for your chair.
<ul>
 	<li>Is this a reasonable accommodation?</li>
 	<li>If not, what would be a more reasonable accommodation?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

REMEMBER- THE DECISION TO DISCLOSE YOUR DISABILITY IS HIGHLY PERSONAL!

Things you should know:
<ul>
 	<li>It is illegal for an employer to ask you if you have a disability! However, an employer CAN ask you if are able to perform the essential function of the job. For example, an employer may say, “Can you perform all of these essential functions?” They also CAN ask about your skills, education, and work history.</li>
 	<li>The employer must make a conditional offer of employment before requiring a medical examination.</li>
 	<li>Any information obtained by your employer about your disability CANNOT be used to discriminate against you in any employment practice. This includes hiring, pay, insurance and other benefits, assignments, training, evaluation, advancement opportunities, promotion, discipline, discharge, and more.</li>
</ul>
