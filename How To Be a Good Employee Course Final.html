<strong>How do you become a good employee? </strong>There are some everyday steps that you can take at work to make sure you are a reliable and respected employee!
<ul>

 	<li>Demonstrate good conflict resolution skills.</li>
 	<li>Cooperate with your co-workers.</li>
 	<li>Follow company rules and regulations.</li>
 	<li>Don't get involved in office politics.</li>

 	<li>Behave in a <span style="color: #ff0000;">positive</span> way!</li>
 	<li>Be <span style="color: #ff0000;">friendly</span> with coworkers.</li>

</ol>
</li>
</ul>

Employees who have <span style="color: #ff0000;">motivation </span>are more productive and enthusiastic! Generally, employers expect that workers will be able to motivate themselves.
<blockquote><strong>Motivation</strong> – In the workplace, this means that you have a desire to achieve your company’s goals, your supervisor’s goals, or your personal goals to do excellent work. Motivation can be external or internal!</blockquote>
Examples of employees with motivation include:
<ul>
 	<li>Staying busy! If they finish their work, they ask for more.</li>
 	<li>They’re excited and ready to learn a different skill or take on a new challenge.</li>
 	<li>If they see a problem, they take action!</li>
</ul>

Try to describe what a <span style="color: #ff0000;">motivated</span> employee would do in these different scenarios.

When starting at a new workplace, it’s important to get a feel for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">workplace culture</span>, or the environment you will be working in.
<blockquote><strong>Workplace Culture</strong> – a shared belief system of values and processes within an organization. It has been described simply as "the way things are done around here."</blockquote>
Some of the characteristics of workplace culture are language, rules, fashion, and authorities.

<ul>
 	<li>At a high-end coffee shop, a barista may say “triple grande skinny” to refer to a medium latte with skim milk and extra espresso.</li>
 	<li>A law firm may use legal <span style="color: #ff0000;">jargon</span> such as “deposition” or “covenant.”</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<blockquote><strong>Jargon</strong> – Terminology which is especially defined in relationship to a specific activity, profession, group, or event. These are the words specific to a particular job or type of job!</blockquote>
For example, some jargon for the baseball team might include “walk-off” or “stolen base.” These are not the same terms that someone on a football team would use!

Each workplace has expectations about what is acceptable to wear to work. Some examples include:<img class=" wp-image-44590 alignright" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/PYD_goodemployee3.png" alt="pyd_goodemployee3" width="218" height="264" />
<ul>
 	<li>A male lawyer must wear a conservative suit and tie to the office.</li>
 	<li>A McDonald’s employee is required to wear a uniform.</li>
</ul>
If there is no set uniform, take a look at what other employees in or close to your position are wearing. Always strive to be neat, which means:
<ul>
 	<li>Ironed clothes.</li>
 	<li>Shirt tucked in.</li>
 	<li>Appropriate length skirt.</li>
</ul>
This is true no matter what other employees may be wearing!

<strong>TIP:</strong> Getting your work clothes and shoes out and ready for the following day each night will help you save time each morning.

<strong>Tips for Grooming and Self Care:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>You should follow the same hygiene routines that you would if you were going to a fancy event (graduation, dinner at a nice restaurant, etc.).</li>
 	<li>Always shower, brush your teeth, and put on deodorant before work!</li>
 	<li>Make sure to have neat, clean hair (and facial hair).</li>
 	<li>Don’t wear too much makeup, cologne, or perfume!</li>
 	<li>Make sure to get enough sleep so you seem rested and energized!</li>
</ol>

<em>Who's the boss?</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Your supervisor is the person who makes the decisions about your employment like hours, schedule, and where your desk is.</li>
 	<li>Try to determine what the structure of your workplace is: Who are your coworkers? Who is your boss? Who is your boss’s boss?</li>
 	<li>Learn about your workplace’s policy for keeping track of work hours.</li>
</ul>
Here is a sample time sheet that you can practice filling out:

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-44596" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/PYD_goodemployee5-1000x986.png" alt="pyd_goodemployee5" width="1000" height="986" />

It’s important to make sure that you aren’t wasting your employer’s time by doing personal things while at work! <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YOUR</strong></span> time while at work includes things like travel to/from work, lunch, and other breaks. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WORK</strong></span> time is the rest of the time, while you are being paid to be productive.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-44601" src="http://p2i.pyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/PYD_goodemployee6.png" alt="pyd_goodemployee6" width="350" height="250" />
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Travel to/from Work</strong> —<strong> </strong> Remember to put your "professional hat" on the minute you walk out the door for work. You never know who might be on the bus, train, or in the lobby! It might be a client, customer, or coworker.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lunch breaks</strong> — Most workplaces have designated space for employees to eat. Clean up after yourself, don’t eat food that doesn’t belong to you (just because it’s in the refrigerator does NOT mean it’s yours), and keep cell phone conversations to a minimum and in a low voice.</li>
 	<li><strong>Breaks</strong> — You are entitled to a certain amount of time each day for breaks. Remember to maintain your professionalism while you are at work, even if you are on your break.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cell phones</strong> — Most places have rules (written or unwritten) about cell phone use. Good rules of thumb are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li>Don’t use them (don’t answer OR make calls) unless you are on your break, and only in places where clients/customers cannot hear you.</li>
 	<li>Do not discuss things on your phone that are inappropriate for the workplace.</li>
</ol>
<strong>TIP</strong>: A good idea is to have your phone on silent or vibrate so that phone calls cannot interrupt your workday.

Doing personal things while you are getting paid is a lot like stealing time from your employer. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Don’t do it!</span></strong> This includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Using the company computer to surf the internet, chat, check your personal emails, or look at Facebook.</li>
 	<li>Making personal calls (either on the company phone or on your cell phone).</li>
</ul>

Being the “new kid on the block” can be difficult, but remember—everybody was new at some time! Here are some tips that can help you: <strong>SMILE</strong>! A smile is the best way to let people (coworkers and customers) know you are happy to be there.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Script for Meeting a New Coworker</strong></span>:
<ul>
 	<li>Introduce yourself! Shake hands and say, “Hi, my name is ___________ and I’m new here.” A firm handshake, good eye contact and a smile will help you make a great first impression!</li>
 	<li>Ask the person their name (they may offer it first) and repeat it when you say, “Nice to meet you, ________________.” You will also want to address the person in a professional way—don’t use first names unless they specifically ask you to.</li>
</ul>
Let’s practice meeting each other! Remember to use good eye contact, SMILE and use a firm handshake.

What happens when you are moving on to a new job?
<ul>
 	<li>Ask for written <span style="color: #ff0000;">reference</span> from your site supervisor! This is best done in writing, and before it’s time for you to leave!</li>
 	<li>Ask for a written reference from a colleague (someone who is in a superior position to you and has been there for a while is best).</li>
 	<li>Make sure that you provide an email or mail address for them to send it to if they cannot provide it right away.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><strong>Reference</strong> – When applying to a new job, you will often be asked for a list of references. These are people who can tell the employer about your skills as an employee. Usually your references should be former supervisors, and a reference may be written in a letter or spoken over the phone.</blockquote>
Put your work information for the job you are leaving on your resume! Include the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Employer's name</li>
 	<li>Supervisor's name and title</li>
 	<li>Dates employed</li>
 	<li>Position held</li>
 	<li>Duties performed</li>
</ul>
