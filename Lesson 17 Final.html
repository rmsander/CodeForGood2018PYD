<strong>Brainstorming Interview Questions</strong>

Take a look at your resume. From looking at your resume, can you think of any questions an employer might want to ask you? For example:
<ul>
 	<li>Why did you leave your last job?</li>
 	<li>What did you do in between…
<ul>
 	<li>Leaving school and beginning work?</li>
 	<li>Leaving school and now?</li>
 	<li>Your past job and current job?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>What was your greatest accomplishment at your last job?</li>
 	<li>How would you use your skills at this job?</li>
 	<li>Tell me more about the volunteer work you did.</li>
</ul>
Try to think of a couple more based off of your resume!

<em>Are there questions that interviewers aren’t allowed to ask you?</em> Yes! By law, you should not be asked anything that reveals your:
<ul>
 	<li>Age</li>
 	<li>Race</li>
 	<li>Gender</li>
 	<li>Religion</li>
 	<li>National Origin</li>
 	<li>Sexual Orientation</li>
 	<li>Marital Status</li>
 	<li>Health</li>
</ul>
If you are asked any questions about these subjects, you do not have to answer! Instead, you could say:

<em>“I’m sorry, but I prefer not to answer that.”</em>

<em>“I am not comfortable answering that question.”</em>

<strong>Illegal Question Examples</strong>: There are many questions that employers are not allowed to ask, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>“What is your maiden name?”</li>
 	<li>“What is your date of birth?”</li>
 	<li>“What is your husband/wife’s profession?”</li>
 	<li>“Do you have any disabilities that would prevent you from performing this job?”</li>
 	<li>“Do you have health issues that would prevent you from performing this job?”</li>
 	<li>“Have you ever been hospitalized?”</li>
</ul>
<strong>Employers <span style="color: #ff0000;">CANNOT</span> ask about your disabilities and health issues until after they have made you a conditional job offer. However, they may ask if you are capable of performing the job requirements.</strong>
