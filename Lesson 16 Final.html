<strong>Types of Interviews</strong>

There are many different types of interviews, and a few are listed here. In general, you will be asked similar questions in each interview, but it is good to be aware of what each type is.

<strong>Screening Interview</strong> -- There are many different types of interviews, and a few are listed here. In general, you will be asked similar questions in each interview, but it is good to be aware of what each type is.

<strong>Personal Interview</strong> -- This is a one-on-one in-person interview that is longer and more in-depth than the screening interview. This could be your second or first interview for a particular job.

<strong>Phone Interview</strong> -- An interviewer will call you to ask questions. This usually happens for screening interviews or long-distance interviews. Here are some tips:
<ul>
 	<li>Have written notes and your resume with you.</li>
 	<li>Be in a quiet space without any distractions.</li>
 	<li>Speak energetically.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Group Interview</strong> -- Several candidates for the job will be brought in at the same time and asked to participate in a discussion or a task. Here are some pointers:
<ul>
 	<li>The purpose is to see how you work with others and communicate.</li>
 	<li>Be polite and listen to everyone's ideas.</li>
 	<li>Show leadership, but don’t be domineering. Instead, act as a guide for the discussion.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Task Oriented Interview</strong> -- An interviewer may ask you to do a simple task or solve a problem to test your critical thinking or judge your knowledge of a certain topic.

<strong>Committee Interview</strong> -- Multiple people from the company or organization might interview you at the same time. This is overwhelming, but treat it as you would a personal interview! Direct your answer to the person who asked the question, but try to make eye contact with everyone. This type of interview often occurs after a personal interview.

Doing well on an interview is not about memorizing answers to all of the questions you might be asked. Instead, it is about <strong>learning how to react and highlight your strengths.</strong> This takes practice!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Situational/Scenarios</strong></span>

This type of interview question usually asks you to describe a time when you did something. It is best to have a couple of situations in mind (leadership roles, challenging projects, etc.). Each answer should focus on the strengths that you can contribute to the job!
<ol>
 	<li>Give an example of how you solved a problem in the past.</li>
 	<li>Give an example of a time you showed leadership and initiative.</li>
 	<li>Give an example of a time you were able to contribute to a team project.</li>
 	<li>Have you ever been on a team where someone was not pulling their own weight? How did you handle it?</li>
 	<li>Tell me about your proudest achievement.</li>
 	<li>Give me an example of a time when you had to think out of the box.</li>
 	<li>Describe how you would handle a situation if you were required to finish multiple tasks by the end of the day and there was no way that you could finish all of them.</li>
 	<li>Describe a difficult work situation or project and how you overcame it.</li>
</ol>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Offbeat</strong></span>

Sometimes employers will ask you odd questions that have nothing to do with the job. If you are asked something that you absolutely do not know, such as #5, do your best to reason through the answer out loud. There are two purposes for offbeat questions: To catch you off guard and see how you handle pressure, and to test your critical thinking skills.
<ol>
 	<li>If you ordered a rare hamburger at a business lunch and they brought it to you well-done, how would you handle it?</li>
 	<li>Should a leader be feared or liked?</li>
 	<li>What was the last book you read?</li>
 	<li>On a scale of one to five, rate me as an interviewer.</li>
 	<li>How many quarters would have to be stacked on top of each other to reach the height of the empire state building?</li>
 	<li>If you were given one million dollars to fund your best entrepreneurial idea, what would you choose to do?</li>
</ol>
